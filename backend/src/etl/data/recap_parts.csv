Bluey adds that Grandad won’t do what Chilli told him to do. Maynard, hearing this, sighed and asks why Grandad wouldn't do what he was told. Grandad once more demands Maynard to hide them instead of answering his question. So Maynard puts down the fishing rod, gets off the bench, and opens the door of the shed. Bingo asks him if he has got the canoe before she hides in, however Maynard doesn't answer her as Chilli’s voice interrupted."
Recap:Episode:Grandad_10,Episode:Grandad,10,"Chilli now is running towards the bank, panting. When she arrives, Maynard is seen sitting on the bench, holding up the mug and pretentiously greeting Chilli. Chilli instantly figures out Maynard has the kids and Grandad hidden adjacently, so she tells Maynard to stop pretending and tell where they are. Maynard, still trying to pretend, asks who ""they"" are, even asking if she had a haircut to distract her. Simultaneously, Grandad, who is curled up with the kids in the narrow shed, grunts, hoping Maynard to successfully prevaricate Chilli. The kids chuckle."
Recap:Episode:Grandad_11,Episode:Grandad,11,"Chilli steps onto the cabin corridor, saying to Maynard that Grandad should accept that he is getting older and need to take care of himself. Maynard, however, says if he was here, he would merely say, “it should have been up to me”, with an imitated voice and posture of Grandad. Immediately, she answers that it shouldn’t, stating seriously that she is his daughter and he should take care of himself for her. When she is about to give a reason, she halts for a moment, then says that she still needs him."
Recap:Episode:Grandad_12,Episode:Grandad,12,"The scene cuts inside the cabin. As Grandad hears those statements, he looks with a sensation of hesitation. Maynard, now knowing Chilli’s initials, looks towards the inside of the cabin and says that only an old fool will ignore that. Suddenly the fish rod pops, as if being dragged by the fish on the hook. Chilli, seeing this, teasingly tells Maynard it could be a barra on the hook. Maynard, however, is still sitting on the bench, hindering the door, until the fish rod is dragged down into the water. He runs and to retrace the rod, Chilli moves the bench and before she enters the cabin, Grandad and the kids come out onto the pier, with Grandad scolding Maynard for not distracting Chilli well enough. He tells the kids to run. Bingo notices the canoe berthed at the end of the pier, so they run to it, with Chilli chasing behind."
Recap:Episode:Grandad_13,Episode:Grandad,13,"Eventually Grandad and the kids get onto the boat before Chilli captures them. Chilli, however, standing at the very end of the pier, looks between the drifting away canoe and the lake surface several times, and dives into the water. As she is approaching the canoe, swimming, Bluey asks what they should do. Bingo grabs the paddle and says, ""We canoe"". So Grandad takes one paddle and tries to paddle the water but fails with his flared-up thumbs, saying the kids will have to paddle instead. Bluey takes over the paddle and says that’s why Grandad needs to rest. Grandad adds that this also explains why the girls have to be big and strong. Meanwhile, Chilli is seen merely dozens of feet near the ship, so Bluey and Bingo paddle the water together and accelerate the canoe until the boat is eventually out of Chilli’s reach, who is soaked in the water, shouting to the fleeing Grandad and kids that she will find them."
Recap:Episode:Grandad_14,Episode:Grandad,14,"As the kids and Grandad arrive at another pier, Bingo asks whether Chilli will find them here. Grandad answers that she will be here soon. Then the scene cuts to Chilli, running in the woods, panting, as Grandad says this was her favorite place when she was young. The kids add that they should flee in the canoe if Chilli arrives. Grandad, however, rejects the idea to run away, instead saying that it’s time for him to take a rest. As he walks to the end of the pier and sits down, he then suggests the kids have a swim, so Bluey and Bingo jump into the water cheerfully."

Unfortunately, it's a long way down for the tiny Pom Pom, who Chilli helps getting down. ""Pomeranians are a small breed"" as the former puts it.

Recap:Episode:Unicorse_2,Episode:Unicorse,2,"Soon Bluey begins to feel disturbed by him, for him blocking the story book, compulsively spoiling the ending, making rude noises when she tries to call him out, to acting very inappropriately at a painful scene in the book.

Recap:Episode:Chest_0,Episode:Chest,0,"Bandit has decided to introduce Bluey to the world of chess (or how Bluey calls it, chest). Chilli voices her concerns that the game would be a bit too complex for her age (she confirms she's six, almost seven), so Bandit reckons now is the appropriate time for Bluey to learn chess. Soon, in comes Bingo; while she may be five, the game would be too complex for her. Bingo is initially unhappy, though Bluey offers her sister to help. Soon afterward, Bingo asks where the dice is (not knowing chess is turn-based)."
Recap:Episode:Chest_1,Episode:Chest,1,"Bandit introduces the pieces of chess to the duo; the pawns (""the little ball guys""/""prawns"" according to Bingo), (Bluey and Bingo add in Chareval and Bonny Bom Bom though Bandit puts the two figures away,) the knight (the ""horsey!""/""Gallahop""/""Daughter of Gallahop""; also Bluey thinks the knight sits on the horsey), and the rook (""Castlehead""; Bingo says castles can't move); also the bishops (""pom-pom elves""). Bluey reaffirms that Bingo is on her team, dividing her half of the grid visibly into two. Bandit makes his first move, though is continually impeded and frustrated by Bluey and Bingo's new rules. Bluey realises that there is one ""wedding cake head"" and ""queen lady"", who turn out to be the two important pieces in the game, the king and queen. Bluey willingly swaps her queen for Bingo's king, thus Bandit has to copy too."
Recap:Episode:Chest_2,Episode:Chest,2,"Bandit says that the king is the most important piece, though Chilli, popping by, shows that the queen is the most important piece due to her ability to move any distance on the grid, in any direction (compared to the king who moves only one square). Meanwhile, Bingo has traversed off with her queen and now behind Bandit's bottom, taking her queen to a nice picnic. However, Bandit catches her and resets the board. It's now Bluey's turn, but she moves her pawn from C2 to D3, an illegal move. She then moves it to C4 after being told to only move pawns forward. Meanwhile, Bingo gets a turn, moving both Gallahop (G1-F6) and a pawn (G2-F7 and occupying a pawn already present). Bingo states the reason for this is so Boulderkiss could visit Ms. Shinyhead, for they're both friends. However, Bluey says they're indeed friends, little prawns even (so they can go to Kindy together), though Bandit immediately removes the knight on F6 with a pawn."
Recap:Episode:Chest_3,Episode:Chest,3,"Bluey initially thinks that Gallahop would start back at his starting position, but Bandit says Gallahop is dead. Bingo is shocked, though Chilli reassures her that he is not dead. Bluey moves Daughter of Gallahop from B1 to A3, though Bandit counters with a bishop from F8. Bluey starts to play aggressively, moving a pawn from C4 to C5, and another from A2 to A3, but Bandit, showing that she needs to protect her pieces, dispatches of both pawns in a matter of seconds with the bishop he played earlier. Bluey moves her queen all the way to the other end of the board, taking out Bandit's queen, but he takes Bluey's queen out using his king."
Recap:Episode:Chest_4,Episode:Chest,4,"With a call from Bluey asking her how exactly to beat Bandit, Chilli, giving a bowl to Bingo (the little Red Heeler had coupled all the pieces removed from active play into a pool party), decides to show her how to beat him in four moves: she moves the bishop from F1 to A6, taking out a pawn, then the rook from A1 to C1, taking out the bishop, moving the pawn on F7 to F8, promoting it to a queen, and moving the piece already on F2 to F4, checkmating Bandit. Using the game of chess as a metaphor, she tells the kids a valuable life lesson: the kids may be little prawns, but they'll be queens one day, and she won't always be there to protect them - the kids would have to look out for themselves, but right now, she'll do anything she can do now to help them."
Recap:Episode:Sheepdog_0,Episode:Sheepdog,0,"It's dinner time at the Heelers', and Chilli is under strain preparing the food. Compounding such is the antics of Bluey and Bingo, the former playing her recorder and the latter telling knock-knock jokes (""Potato drives a car to the potato shop, and... buys a potato.""), as Bandit returns from the barber's with a mullet on his head. Eventually, Chilli decides she wants some alone time for 20 minutes, which concerns Bluey, as she doesn't usually see her Mum take some alone time. (On the way out of the kitchen, Chilli notices Bandit's mullet; he says she told him they're back in.)"
Recap:Episode:Sheepdog_1,Episode:Sheepdog,1,"Bandit reassures Bluey she didn't do anything wrong, and explains the anatomy of a mullet to Bingo (his definition of a mullet is ""a type of haircut that cool people are starting to get again"").

While Bingo is indeed amused, Bluey isn't, as she's rather determined to check up on her Mum. Seeing this, Bandit willingly ropes the Heeler kids into a game of Sheepdog - a game he definitely doesn't enjoy."
Recap:Episode:Sheepdog_2,Episode:Sheepdog,2,"Soon, Bandit is in the backyard on all fours, acting like a sheep. Bingo feeds him some grass, but he pretends to eat it; Bingo, wanting some accuracy, reiterates that he has to eat it, for real life. So he eats the grass, though he immediately spits it out. Bluey gets an idea: she'll put a ribbon on Bandit's hair. However, she doesn't know where the ribbons are, so she goes off to ask Chilli. Bandit, hearing this, runs after Bluey, but she's too fast for the sheepdog, eventually evading him and entering the house. Intending to distract her, he decides to get into the trampoline, where he's now stuck inside bouncing. Bluey tries to bait him out with grass, but Bingo tells her that the sheepdog doesn't like grass."

The heartfelt moment is brought to a halt when the sheepdog Bandit has managed to wander off to Wendy's house and is eating her laundry.

The Heelers attack, and with a little help from Bluey drawing her a jump, Bingo rams Humpty, granting him his great fall. Bandit and Doug are now freed from the yolky prison, and celebrate by making scrambled eggs."

Recap:Episode:Cricket_0,Episode:Cricket,0,"The episode begins with Bandit narrating about a time they tried getting Rusty out in a game of cricket taking place on an unknown kid's birthday. Bandit catches the tennis ball and hands it to Bluey, who is bowling, while Bingo is batting. Bluey clumsily bowls to Bingo, who equally clumsily fails to hit it, instead knocking over the plastic stumps with her bat, and getting out. Stripe is next to bat, and Bandit, taking up the ball, jokes the fielders need to move in close (implying that he is a terrible batter). Stripe gets his revenge by driving Bandit's delivery straight for a full toss and scoring six and out (as commonly happens in games of backyard cricket when the ball lands in a neighbour's yard)."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_1,Episode:Cricket,1,"Pat calls out to ask who hasn't batted yet. Bluey mentions Rusty hasn't, so Pat calls Rusty down. Rusty meanwhile is demonstrating fielding technique to his little sister, Dusty."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_2,Episode:Cricket,2,"Bluey suggests playing tiggy instead and says that cricket is just about hitting a ball around the grass. Bandit says that cricket is about more than that, and says they will stop playing as soon as they get Rusty out. Bluey warns that they will never get Rusty out. Bandit, unconcerned, makes a gentle delivery to Rusty, which he immediately drives straight for four, narrowly missing Bandit in the process."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_3,Episode:Cricket,3,"Bandit, his pride wounded, ups the challenge by asking Rusty if he is OK if he swings the ball."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_4,Episode:Cricket,4,"The scene cuts to Rusty's house, where he's playing with his brother Digger and his sister Dusty in their front yard. Rusty takes his cricket seriously - he refuses to hit his sister a catch because he wants to make 50. The scene then cuts to show Rusty obsessively training on his own by bouncing a tennis ball against a wall with his bat. We then cut back to the park. Rusty easily handles Bandit's swing, cutting it to gully and scoring multiple runs. Snickers attempts to return the ball but unfortunately, his small dachshund arms are unable to throw it very far. Pat still encourages Snickers. The dads (Pat, Stripe and Bandit) discuss a plan to get Rusty out: Pat and Stripe will move to gully and point respectively and Bandit will target Rusty's off stump to trap him, making him cut the ball to the two dads."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_5,Episode:Cricket,5,"Unfortunately for the dads, we then see that Rusty has practised in the past for this exact situation: at home, his square cut would accidentally go through the kitchen window, infuriating his mum. Therefore Rusty has been carefully perfecting his square cut, practising until he can bounce the ball off the side of his house to knock a tin can off the top of a stick. The scene then cuts back to the park: Bandit delivers the ball to the off stump, and Rusty expertly cuts it between the two fielding dads."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_6,Episode:Cricket,6,"Stripe takes the ball from Bandit, accusing him of bowling pies (bad deliveries). He then asks Rusty if he is capable of handling spin bowling. Bandit thinks Stripe is a terrible spinner, but Pat points out a crack on the pitch near the leg stump which Stripe can use. The scene then cuts away again: Rusty playing cricket in the front yard of his friend Jack, which is dusty and filled with tree roots and seed pods. Rusty has had plenty of practice at handling rough wickets (bumpy cricket pitches), and after many attempts, he manages to hit the ball onto the roof of Jack's house. Bandit comments that Rusty could handle Stripe's fruit (i.e. inconsistent bowling) any day, and sure enough, Rusty easily hooks Stripe's delivery out to leg side, much to Bandit's amusement."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_7,Episode:Cricket,7,"Bandit narrates that every batter has a weakness, and for Rusty, it is pace attacks. Pat retrieves the ball from Lucky and asks Rusty if it is okay if he has a go. Rusty looks frightened as he remembers playing against his older brother's mates, including a terrifying pace bowler called Tiny. Rusty hesitantly volunteers to bat against Tiny. Digger, having just been bowled cleanly by Tiny, gives his pads to Rusty and warns that they won't go easy on him, but Rusty decides to try it out anyway."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_8,Episode:Cricket,8,"Tiny's fast delivery, with a real, very old and battered, cricket ball, hits Rusty on the body and he limps home disheartened. That night, his brother tells him that he can try again when he's a bit older. Rusty, even though he is scared of Tiny, refuses to give up. Trying again next time, he flinches at Tiny's delivery, leaving his stumps unprotected and he is bowled out. Then, he reads a letter from his dad, who is on deployment: His dad tells him that there are harder things in the world than a cricket ball, and when you face a pace attack you have two choices, back away (like the kid we see flinching from Tiny's pace and getting bowled) or stepping forward and playing a pull shot. The latter is what Rusty does, scoring a four. Rusty's dad tells him to keep his eye on the ball and take care of his little sister."
Recap:Episode:Cricket_9,Episode:Cricket,9,"The scene then cuts back to the park. Pat bowls a ferocious short-pitched ball, which Rusty pulls out to leg side, frustrating Pat. Chilli calls out that it's time for lunch and everyone leaves, but Pat is determined to get Rusty out and makes him return to the crease for one more. Rusty, Bandit narrates, would happily play fifty more deliveries: he just loves cricket. The scene then cuts to why he loves the game: Rusty's family (including his dad) playing a game of beach cricket together. The scene cuts back to the park again. Pat bowls with everything he has, and Bandit says Rusty could have easily hit it into next week if he wanted to, but instead, he chooses to hit a full toss straight to his little sister to catch it (getting him out). Bandit explains to Bluey that that is what cricket is about."
